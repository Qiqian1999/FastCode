Our project is made up of two parts: code and data.

data is under the layers foler and code is all the .h and .cpp in the root dictionary.

The experiment code is in the Use.cpp main function.

We have three experiments within the Use.cpp: effect of the Optimization, Comparison with different Problem Sizes and Inference with Deep Convolution Neural Nets.

Whichever you wanna see the result, just remove the comment and compile it with the Makefile.


Makefile: make -> compile all the code
          make clean -> clean all the result

Our code could run on ECE cluster machines
